## Unit 3: Introduction to HTML

First coding section of the course. Practice creating html pages using the appropriate tags.

### firstpage.html

A simple html page following html 5 guidlines to show the use of tags.

### quiz1.html

The first html assignment. Practice in using lists. The goal is to recreate an image the colt has placed in the video using html code.

### quiz2.html

Again same assignment design of quiz 1 where we are tasked with recreating a web page based on imagery in the video alone. This quiz addresses the use of imagery and links to additional pages.

## Unit 4: Intermediate HTML

The next section which begins to show more advanced concepts of HTML

### inputs.html

Practice file for html input fields.

### quiz3.html

The first exercise in the seciton. Us a table and provided data to build an html table about the generation 1 starters of pokemon.

### quiz4.html

The second exercise. A simple yet robust form to be built that forces a person to register certain amount of information. They are specified fields that are required and require a certain length.

## Unit 5: Introduction to CSS

this is the 4th unit the course and covers the beginning skills when using css to style an html document.

### Selectors exercise

the only quiz in the section that uses a css file to alter the accompanying html file.

## Unit 6: Intermediate CSS

The next section in the course. This section covers work done when dealing with more advanced concepts of CSS.

### TicTacToe

a simple stylization exercise to make a tic tac toe board on the screen using css.

### Photography Code Along

A code along project that creates a small web portfolio for black and white photos as if we were the photgrapher. This is accomplished using css and a simple html file to hold the images.

### Blog exercise

this is the first big css project. We are to build from a scratch a blog with two posts and a unique styling. The project involves manipulation of different elements in css and an html file contianing the posts.

#### Colt's Solution

Is the coded along version of Colt's solution to the blog exercise. I have achieved a similar result in my work, but this is the direct solution form Colt.

## Unit 7: Bootstrap (Bootstrap 3)

In this section of the course. Colt starts to dive into using the bootstrap 3 framework. The basics.html file is some sample code of using bootstrap to make a framework of tools for a well crafted website.

### Image Gallery Project

This is the first of two code along projects. In this project we code along with Colt and use a combination of Boostrap 3, CSS, and HTML to build a fast, responsive, minimal but well layed out web page for holding a small image gallery of 9 images. None of the images are mine and all were taken from the course. When it is completed, the web pages houses a few bootstrap items and an image gallery using the bootstrap grid system. The project also highlights the importance of specificity and the web development tools inside the browser to show that even though we want custom designs, we need to make sure we have the specificity, otherwise bootstrap will over rule.

### Landing Page

This is the second code along project in the unit. In this project, we use bootstrap 3 to build a well rounded albeit minimalist design for a landing page for a website. This project again uses bootstrap 3 to illustrate the benefits of using the bootstrap framework and at the same time allows us to show customization of prebuilt tools.

## Unit 8 & 9: Bootstrap 4

this unit covers the changes made in bootstrap from version 3 to 4. The html files in this folder are all code alongs to demonstrate the changes made in the version changes. Colt goes into them more in detail in the video. HTML files are individual video lecture code alongs that are for practice in using the specific new utilities.

### Pattern Project

First code along project using Bootstrap 4. This project recreates a small image gallery in cards. It takes advantge of the new utilities of bootstrap 4.

### Museum of Candy

This is the second code along project in the Bootstrap 4 seciton. This Project is large in comparison to others. This takes advantage of the new features in bootstrap 4 and tries to create a small yet responsive web page that does not appear to use bootstrap as much. It is a light weight design with additional features along side a small snippet of javascript to make a transition affect.

## Unit 10: Introduction to Javascript

This seciton is the bsaics to the underlying scripts of javascript. This is where the functional side of the web developement begins. This section covers the very basics of coding in javascript. The smaler files are simplemcode alongs during the lecture videos.

### Age calculator

a simple java script file that takes in teh user's age and reports back how many days they have roughly been alive.

### Stalker Exercise

Is a simple script that takes in information from the user and quietly reports it back to the console.

## Unit 11: Javascript Basics - Control Flow

this section covers boolean logic and control flow using the while loop, for loop, and if conditionals. Here we beign to exercise logic and decide what code is run.

### Annoy-omatic

Is a simple script that uses a while loops that doens't end until the user enters correct input. it will constantly create a pop up asking the same question otherwise.

### Conditionals

Is a small exercise to practice using the if statement and conditional logic.

### For loops Problem Set

Is tkaing the problem set from the while loops and recreatign them in the structure of a for loop.

### GuessingGame

Is a simple guess the number that is hard coded game. The user will be prompted for a number and depending on their guess be given a response.

### While Loops

A set of problesm to practice using the while loop ina  form of code repetition.

## Unit 12: Javascript Basics - Functions

This section covers on function declaration and function expression. The three fies are possible solutions to solving the exercises Colt gives in the lecture video. I did not reate html files to accompany these. I ran them in my computer's terminal using node.js.

## Unit 13: javascript Basics - Arrays

This unit covers arrays in javascript and manipulating them. There are two folders that I created in this section. One is the folder that contains all the javascript for the exercise problems that Colt assigns in this section. Again run using node.js in the terminal so no accompanying html files or css. The other is the code along for the todo list project which builds a simple todo list that prints and functions more through the console but takes input through prompts on the html page.

### Array Problem set

Folder containung the exercise problems from this section.

### Todo List Code along

The todo list code along project.

### Unit 14: Javascript Basics: Objects

This section covers the object, and how to code them into javascript. This is the very basic start of object oriented programming but OOP is the not the focus of the section. Just the idea of an object. how to access data inside, manipulate the data inside, and assign methods to the object.

### movieDatabase.js

The solitary file in the folder. This is the one exercise that Colt assigns that we need to code. In this file, we build an array of movie objects which consist of a title, rating, and a boolean value of being watched. We then loop through the array and access the individual elements and print out some dialogue. Again run through node.js in the terminal so no additional files were created.

## Unit 15 & 16: DOM Manipulation

These sections cover basic and advanced DOM manipulation. The exercsie Colt gives are designed to practice manipulting a web page via js and the DOM.

### Color toggle Exercise

A simple web page with a single button that when clicked changes the color of the background. This is the first exerise and basic use of manipulating the DOM.

## ScoreKeeper

A first but very basic web app that helps keep scores for two players in a game. They may adjust the score limit and reset the counter as well. The winning score will also be changed to green text when reached.

## Unit 17: Color Game

This unit is entirely a code along project. We use the tools we hav learned so far: html, css, javascript, DOM manipulation. to buld a web based game.

## Units 18 & 19: Introduction and Advanced jQuery

This folder has some work sing jQuery. There are only some exercises but no projects. The exercises are merely use to show use of jQuery and it's power It alos highlights that I can, at times, be unnecessary as we can do everything in jQuery with javascript and CSS.

## Unit 20: Todo List Projects

Refactored the todo list project using the tools in jQuery and css.

## Unit 21: Pata Tap Clone

This was a simple and optional section that showed us how to make a pata tap cone using papaerscript.js. The App creates circles and sounds when pressing certain keys on the keyboard. This was an optional project to show we cna make a full script in our html that avoids some errors.

## Unit 22: Backend Basics

There was no work done in this folder. It was a simple information section. Colt only asked us to take notes until a certain point and then just prepare as we would go over everything in it's entirety later on in the course.

## Unit 23: The Command Line

This was a an introduction into the command line. there is an exercise but it is not in a file. This secton was a brief yet powerful intro into using the command line. This is a powerful and useful section for those whom have never used the command line.

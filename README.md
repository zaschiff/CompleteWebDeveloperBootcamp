### quiz1.html

The first html assignment. Practice in using lists. The goal is to recreate an image the colt has placed in the video using html code.

### quiz2.html

Again same assignment design of quiz 1 where we are tasked with recreating a web page based on imagery in the video alone. This quiz addresses the use of imagery and links to additional pages.

## Unit 4: Intermediate HTML

The next section which begins to show more advanced concepts of HTML

### inputs.html

Practice file for html input fields.

### quiz3.html

The first exercise in the seciton. Us a table and provided data to build an html table about the generation 1 starters of pokemon.

### quiz4.html

The second exercise. A simple yet robust form to be built that forces a person to register certain amount of information. They are specified fields that are required and require a certain length.

## Unit 5: Introduction to CSS

this is the 4th unit the course and covers the beginning skills when using css to style an html document.

### Selectors exercise

the only quiz in the section that uses a css file to alter the accompanying html file.

## Unit 6: Intermediate CSS

The next section in the course. This section covers work done when dealing with more advanced concepts of CSS.

### TicTacToe

a simple stylization exercise to make a tic tac toe board on the screen using css.

### Photography Code Along

A code along project that creates a small web portfolio for black and white photos as if we were the photgrapher. This is accomplished using css and a simple html file to hold the images.

### Blog exercise

this is the first big css project. We are to build from a scratch a blog with two posts and a unique styling. The project involves manipulation of different elements in css and an html file contianing the posts.

#### Colt's Solution

Is the coded along version of Colt's solution to the blog exercise. I have achieved a similar result in my work, but this is the direct solution form Colt.

## Unit 7: Bootstrap (Bootstrap 3)

In this section of the course. Colt starts to dive into using the bootstrap 3 framework. The basics.html file is some sample code of using bootstrap to make a framework of tools for a well crafted website.

### Image Gallery Project

This is the first of two code along projects. In this project we code along with Colt and use a combination of Boostrap 3, CSS, and HTML to build a fast, responsive, minimal but well layed out web page for holding a small image gallery of 9 images. None of the images are mine and all were taken from the course. When it is completed, the web pages houses a few bootstrap items and an image gallery using the bootstrap grid system. The project also highlights the importance of specificity and the web development tools inside the browser to show that even though we want custom designs, we need to make sure we have the specificity, otherwise bootstrap will over rule.

### Landing Page

This is the second code along project in the unit. In this project, we use bootstrap 3 to build a well rounded albeit minimalist design for a landing page for a website. This project again uses bootstrap 3 to illustrate the benefits of using the bootstrap framework and at the same time allows us to show customization of prebuilt tools.

## Unit 8 & 9: Bootstrap 4

this unit covers the changes made in bootstrap from version 3 to 4. The html files in this folder are all code alongs to demonstrate the changes made in the version changes. Colt goes into them more in detail in the video. HTML files are individual video lecture code alongs that are for practice in using the specific new utilities.

### Pattern Project

First code along project using Bootstrap 4. This project recreates a small image gallery in cards. It takes advantge of the new utilities of bootstrap 4.

### Museum of Candy

This is the second code along project in the Bootstrap 4 seciton. This Project is large in comparison to others. This takes advantage of the new features in bootstrap 4 and tries to create a small yet responsive web page that does not appear to use bootstrap as much. It is a light weight design with additional features along side a small snippet of javascript to make a transition affect.

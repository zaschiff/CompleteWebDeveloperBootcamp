## Unit 3: Introduction to HTML

First coding section of the course. Practice creating html pages using the appropriate tags.

### firstpage.html

A simple html page following html 5 guidlines to show the use of tags.

### quiz1.html

The first html assignment. Practice in using lists. The goal is to recreate an image the colt has placed in the video using html code.

### quiz2.html

Again same assignment design of quiz 1 where we are tasked with recreating a web page based on imagery in the video alone. This quiz addresses the use of imagery and links to additional pages.

## Unit 4: Intermediate HTML

The next section which begins to show more advanced concepts of HTML

### inputs.html

Practice file for html input fields.

### quiz3.html

The first exercise in the seciton. Us a table and provided data to build an html table about the generation 1 starters of pokemon.

### quiz4.html

The second exercise. A simple yet robust form to be built that forces a person to register certain amount of information. They are specified fields that are required and require a certain length.

## Unit 5: Introduction to CSS

this is the 4th unit the course and covers the beginning skills when using css to style an html document.

### Selectors exercise

the only quiz in the section that uses a css file to alter the accompanying html file.

## Unit 6: Intermediate CSS

The next section in the course. This section covers work done when dealing with more advanced concepts of CSS.

### TicTacToe

a simple stylization exercise to make a tic tac toe board on the screen using css.

### Photography Code Along

A code along project that creates a small web portfolio for black and white photos as if we were the photgrapher. This is accomplished using css and a simple html file to hold the images.

### Blog exercise

this is the first big css project. We are to build from a scratch a blog with two posts and a unique styling. The project involves manipulation of different elements in css and an html file contianing the posts.

#### Colt's Solution

Is the coded along version of Colt's solution to the blog exercise. I have achieved a similar result in my work, but this is the direct solution form Colt.

## Unit 7: Bootstrap (Bootstrap 3)

In this section of the course. Colt starts to dive into using the bootstrap 3 framework. The basics.html file is some sample code of using bootstrap to make a framework of tools for a well crafted website.

### Image Gallery Project

This is the first of two code along projects. In this project we code along with Colt and use a combination of Boostrap 3, CSS, and HTML to build a fast, responsive, minimal but well layed out web page for holding a small image gallery of 9 images. None of the images are mine and all were taken from the course. When it is completed, the web pages houses a few bootstrap items and an image gallery using the bootstrap grid system. The project also highlights the importance of specificity and the web development tools inside the browser to show that even though we want custom designs, we need to make sure we have the specificity, otherwise bootstrap will over rule.

### Landing Page

This is the second code along project in the unit. In this project, we use bootstrap 3 to build a well rounded albeit minimalist design for a landing page for a website. This project again uses bootstrap 3 to illustrate the benefits of using the bootstrap framework and at the same time allows us to show customization of prebuilt tools.

## Unit 8 & 9: Bootstrap 4

this unit covers the changes made in bootstrap from version 3 to 4. The html files in this folder are all code alongs to demonstrate the changes made in the version changes. Colt goes into them more in detail in the video. HTML files are individual video lecture code alongs that are for practice in using the specific new utilities.

### Pattern Project

First code along project using Bootstrap 4. This project recreates a small image gallery in cards. It takes advantge of the new utilities of bootstrap 4.

### Museum of Candy

This is the second code along project in the Bootstrap 4 seciton. This Project is large in comparison to others. This takes advantage of the new features in bootstrap 4 and tries to create a small yet responsive web page that does not appear to use bootstrap as much. It is a light weight design with additional features along side a small snippet of javascript to make a transition affect.

## Unit 10: Introduction to Javascript

This seciton is the bsaics to the underlying scripts of javascript. This is where the functional side of the web developement begins. This section covers the very basics of coding in javascript. The smaler files are simplemcode alongs during the lecture videos.

### Age calculator

a simple java script file that takes in teh user's age and reports back how many days they have roughly been alive.

### Stalker Exercise

Is a simple script that takes in information from the user and quietly reports it back to the console.

## Unit 11: Javascript Basics - Control Flow

this section covers boolean logic and control flow using the while loop, for loop, and if conditionals. Here we beign to exercise logic and decide what code is run.

### Annoy-omatic

Is a simple script that uses a while loops that doens't end until the user enters correct input. it will constantly create a pop up asking the same question otherwise.

### Conditionals

Is a small exercise to practice using the if statement and conditional logic.

### For loops Problem Set

Is tkaing the problem set from the while loops and recreatign them in the structure of a for loop.

### GuessingGame

Is a simple guess the number that is hard coded game. The user will be prompted for a number and depending on their guess be given a response.

### While Loops

A set of problesm to practice using the while loop ina  form of code repetition.

## Unit 12: Javascript Basics - Functions

This section covers on function declaration and function expression. The three fies are possible solutions to solving the exercises Colt gives in the lecture video. I did not reate html files to accompany these. I ran them in my computer's terminal using node.js.

## Unit 13: javascript Basics - Arrays

This unit covers arrays in javascript and manipulating them. There are two folders that I created in this section. One is the folder that contains all the javascript for the exercise problems that Colt assigns in this section. Again run using node.js in the terminal so no accompanying html files or css. The other is the code along for the todo list project which builds a simple todo list that prints and functions more through the console but takes input through prompts on the html page.

### Array Problem set

Folder containung the exercise problems from this section.

### Todo List Code along

The todo list code along project.

### Unit 14: Javascript Basics: Objects

This section covers the object, and how to code them into javascript. This is the very basic start of object oriented programming but OOP is the not the focus of the section. Just the idea of an object. how to access data inside, manipulate the data inside, and assign methods to the object.

### movieDatabase.js

The solitary file in the folder. This is the one exercise that Colt assigns that we need to code. In this file, we build an array of movie objects which consist of a title, rating, and a boolean value of being watched. We then loop through the array and access the individual elements and print out some dialogue. Again run through node.js in the terminal so no additional files were created.

## Unit 15 & 16: DOM Manipulation

These sections cover basic and advanced DOM manipulation. The exercsie Colt gives are designed to practice manipulting a web page via js and the DOM.

### Color toggle Exercise

A simple web page with a single button that when clicked changes the color of the background. This is the first exerise and basic use of manipulating the DOM.

## ScoreKeeper

A first but very basic web app that helps keep scores for two players in a game. They may adjust the score limit and reset the counter as well. The winning score will also be changed to green text when reached.

## Unit 17: Color Game

This unit is entirely a code along project. We use the tools we hav learned so far: html, css, javascript, DOM manipulation. to buld a web based game.

## Units 18 & 19: Introduction and Advanced jQuery

This folder has some work sing jQuery. There are only some exercises but no projects. The exercises are merely use to show use of jQuery and it's power It alos highlights that I can, at times, be unnecessary as we can do everything in jQuery with javascript and CSS.

## Unit 20: Todo List Projects

Refactored the todo list project using the tools in jQuery and css.

## Unit 21: Pata Tap Clone

This was a simple and optional section that showed us how to make a pata tap cone using papaerscript.js. The App creates circles and sounds when pressing certain keys on the keyboard. This was an optional project to show we cna make a full script in our html that avoids some errors.

## Unit 22: Backend Basics

There was no work done in this folder. It was a simple information section. Colt only asked us to take notes until a certain point and then just prepare as we would go over everything in it's entirety later on in the course.

## Unit 23: The Command Line

This was a an introduction into the command line. there is an exercise but it is not in a file. This secton was a brief yet powerful intro into using the command line. This is a powerful and useful section for those whom have never used the command line.

## Unit 24: Node JS

this section covers the use and content of Node.js. This seciton was written in goorm and brought over from goorm in order to be placed in the repo. The code will both run in the a personal set up using node, or in goorm.

### demoApp

This app was first created in goorm. It was a small code along to show the installation process using npm and packages. Along side using the installed packages in our code with the require fucntion.

### MyShop

This is the exercise in section 24. The exercise requires us to install the package _faker_ using npm. Then use the package to create a list of 10 random products and their prices. This all needs to be output to the console.

## Unit 25 & 26: Server Side Framework & Intermediate Express (repectively)

This section covers the use of express and how we can minpulate this lightweight framework to do our bidding when designing an web app or site. After learning the bare bones basics in utilizing express. The following unit, unit 26, dives deeper into refactoring and gaining greater control over the framework. We need to install several packages from npm in order for the entire code to work, but in the end we have made some small yet working web apps that can be launched form our local machine. DUring these lectures, had set up an accunt to use the cloud IDE, Goorm, but had previously set up two working local machines, one linux and one windows to go back and forth upon. With that being said, all code was done on one of the two mahcines. I had touched Goorm very little. If code does not work, please refer to lecturs notes for tiehr the PORT section or learn to configure your own machine to allow port access. for my windows machine I did need to manipulate the script execution policy. Since this can affect machine in a negative way it was only when testing code, not when running scripts outside of learning or my personal coding and I do not recommend leaving policy changes due to security reasons. There was one exercise in unit 25, the folder is labeled ExpressExercise, the other folders are mere code alongs done wuth Colt.

### ExpressExercise

the sole exercise in the two units. We are tasked with manipulating routes using javascript and express, while immplementing the ejs view engine.

### FirstExpressApp

the first code along in the lecture to demonstrat the basic use of express the the ejs engine.

### moreExpress

the second code along. This project shows more advanced work when using the framework and engine to make more realistic boilerplate changes to the html.

### PostRequestDemo

a small code along to demonstrate the use of express to amke post requests and to modify data in the backend of our javascript and html.

## Unit 27: Working with API's

This unit covers the stack's use of making a wbe call to an api endpoint, another source of information. BY making this call we can collect data from other sources allowing our application to do more with less work involved.

### ApiRequestDemo

This application is small js file that shows the use of Axios to make a web call. In the lecture vieo Colt uses the npm package _request_ but in a side note and additional video the TA, Ian, states that this package is deprecated and that a comparable package is _Axios_. There are some changes that need to be made in order for it to work unlike additional packages needed for _request_ to function. Another difference in this file vs. the lecture video is the api to which I am calling. The yahoo api Colt uses in the video is no longer free for public use. It is still free, but a developer account must be made to get an api key. Instead, Ian recommmends a different api call that generates fake data to test the api call. Tis is again mention in the side video posted by Ian.

### movieDB

A small code along project that shows us the a lightweight but real use scenario in making an api call. We use a form field to query a website for movie titles and years. The site __omdbapi.com__ does require an api key which Ian provides in a side not prior to the code along project. I made into a variable to store it rather than trying to remember it all the time, making string concatenation far easier.

## Unit 28: YelpCamp Basics

This is the first course section were we begin to use everything we have learned in order to build a fast responsive, website with very little work put in. We use the tools we have covereed including but not limited to: _bootstrap, node.js, express, & ejs_. There is another seciton on compelteing this project that involves databases but has been separated for the database section to be covered.

## Unit 29: Databases

This unit covers the use of MongoDB and the package mongoose. This Pakcage allows us to connect to a mongodb databse and modify it with in our javascript code. This unit has a solitary file worth looking at and that is cats.js. In order for this javascript file to work, the database needs to be running. Colt does describe how to do this in a lecture but the coomand to be run in your terminal (assuming your mongodb is set up correctly ojn your machine) is: _mongod (for linux users)_. In order to run this on windows, simply run the mongo.exe file in a command prompt with admin access (if you installed the mongoDB as windows service as I did. Otherwise refer to the mongo support docs.)

## Unit 30: yelpCamp Data Persistance

This unit covers the addition of the mongo database. We add the mongo database in order to keep the changes made to the as far as adding cmapsites and other pieces of data. This project has now hit its second stage. The updated code is in folder __v2__. the code from unit 28 is inside the folder __v1__

## Unit 31: RESTful Routing

This unit covers the 7 steps in a REST process for a web app. The chart.html was designed by Colt to show the url patterna and design for each step. The 7 steps are a design patern that is universally followed. It details how an app shoulw structure its pages in relation to the methods used. The app, Blog, shows this design and its highly notated mehtods. The RESt structure must be adhered to in order for it to be  RESTful app.

## Unit 32: Data Association

This section covers how to relate on databased object to another. Using mongoDB, there are two methods and Colt goes over them both in the section. The javascript files are named for their respective methods used. He then goes over modularizing the code. Breaking code into multiple files so that the main file is not massive.

## Unit 33: YelpCamp: Comments

In this section we continue to use the yelp camp project and make versions 3 and 4. We have added new data persistnace that kills and rebuilds the database. We have also added in the funcitonality of referenceing one collection to another in our models in order to connect them. By doing this we have added more functionality to our application. We then made more stylistic changes in order ot mkae the pages more appealing. The two folders for the section are labeled _v3_ and _v4_ under the _yelp camp_ folder.

## Unit 34: Authentication

In this section we cover the use of authentication for a web app. The pakcages in use that Colt recommends (but we are not limited to) are passport, passport-local, and passport-local-mongoose. We utilize these three packages and design a middleware function to control access to certain pages with in our web application. By using authentication we can also tie information to the profile in use.

### AuthDemo

This standalone application shows the use of passport and creating middleware functions.

## Units 35 & 36: YelpCamp Auth, Cleaning up Yelpcamp

These two secitons create folders _v5_ and _v6_ respectively. In teh first of the two sections we add authorization to the yelpcamp application which not only allows us to manipulate who can add campgrounds and comments to the database, but who can see what. The authorization piece also allows us to tie comments to a user and display their profile name when on the show page to demonstrate the connection and usefulness of connecting the two pieces. Unit 36 is mere clean up and refactoring. IN this section we break down the massive app.js file into multiple pieces and subdriectories whihc is called __modularizing__ the code and makes it much more manageable in that form. By doing this, we have more files, but less lines of code search through should there be an error. This also allows us to add more to the project with out having to make create more code. We can also remove pieces should they become broken, or unneeded in the same manner.

## Unit 37: YelpCamp - Update and Destroy

This section covers adding in the two other RESTful routes of update and destroy. We add in the functionality of being able to add a new camp ground, edit if we made a mistake when entering in the information, and destroying the campground if we no longer want in the database. BY doing this we compeletete REST structure whne surrounding a cmapground object with in the database. We do the same thing for comments as well. Finally to protect our data, and make sure that others can not modify the database outside of what they have contributed. We have creatde a small piece of middleware to check the user for both authentication as they log into the sight. We also check the user if they are authorized to modiyf the given object and element. By doing this, we implement authentication and authorization to our application. All of this code is in folder _v7_ inside of _yelpCamp_. Colt's folder has hit v10 by this point but he created a new folder a few different times including multiple times in a section. I decided ot update mine with section rather than each subtantial change.
